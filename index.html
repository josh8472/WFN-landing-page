                <p>Restoration organisations are ready and willing to rebuild nature, but without the land to restore, their efforts hit a roadblock. Securing land requires convincing and incentivising landholders to give over a portion of their land and even those landholders who are ready to sign over land can usually only give over a small portion for reforestation. Without the land to work on, we're left floating down a certain type of creek with no paddle.</p>

                <summary>How does this work?</summary>
                <p>You subscribe to offset a portion of your ecological footprint, we pool all the money from subscribers to buy land, and then we work with our restoration partner to restore the land. Where possible, we'll put a conservation overlay over the property to make sure that it is always protected. In return for your subscription, as well as offsetting a portion of your ecological footprint, you get discounts at a range of businesses, and the chance to win prizes that are both awesome and help you move to a more environmentally friendly lifestyle.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>What is an ecological footprint?</summary>
                <p>Your ecological footprint is the impact you have on the environment in terms of the natural resources required and how much land is used per year to sustain your day-to-day living. At the moment, humanity is using way more resources in a year than the planet can sustain. We're on the fast track to ecological disaster, but if we all pull together and tackle this on multiple fronts, we can stop this from happening.<br><br>Your ecological footprint is measured in hectares per person per year. To help visualise that, 1ha is a square with sides of 100m each. That grassy bit inside an athletics track is 1.12ha. An international rugby field is 1.008ha.<br><br>So what is your ecological footprint? According to the National Ecological Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts, 2022 Edition, the allowable land use per person per year is 1.6ha. The average land use per person in Australia is 7.1ha! That's more than four times what the Earth can sustain and two and a half times higher than the world average. The world average is nearly two times higher than levels that the Earth can sustain. We are all using more than we have. We have to both reduce and offset our usage.<br><br>There are great organisations here in Australia and around the world racing and struggling to tackle this problem.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How do we choose where to buy land?</summary>
                <p>We work closely with our restoration partner, Greening Australia's science team to figure out where the best and most effective places are to buy land. Things that are considered include: bang for buck, tree and plant species that can be restored, potential for habitat connectivity to protect wildlife and protect biodiversity, and a whole lot more. Typically this will be on former farm and grazing land.<br><br>We buy land all over Australia in areas where we can make an impact.</p>

            <details>
                <summary>Why social enterprise instead of not-for-profit?</summary>
                <p>We are a for purpose business. We don't want to have to seek handouts and donations to get this to work. As a social enterprise, like any business, we can bring on equity investors. Not for profit charities cannot have equity investors. We also want to show that people and businesses can profit from protecting the environment and biodiversity, so we believe the best way for us to do that is to build a great business.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Where does my money go?</summary>
                <p>Win for Nature currently does not pay any salaries and uses all funds to help rebuild nature and build the community of subscribers that want to help save the planet. Helping to build the subscriber base includes all our marketing and administration costs (administration costs do NOT include salaries). Think of that as a kind of Kickstarter so we can build Win for Nature into something that can make a real difference. In return for kickstarting this social enterprise, you get immediate access to discounts with our discount partners, and loyalty bonuses in the form of additional tickets into the giveaways, once they're announced. For more info on how joining early can give you big chances to win, click on the 'Be the first to know' button on the top right of your screen.<br><br>Once we've announced the giveaways, then we will start paying salaries, which will be capped at 5% of revenue.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Do I have to be over 18 to subscribe?</summary>
                <p>No. All ages are welcome to subscribe and offset their ecological footprint as well as take advantage of our discount rewards program and entries into the giveaways.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>How do I access the discounts?</summary>
                <p>Once we're live and you subscribe to offset your ecological footprint, you'll have access to the membership dashboard that includes a page for our discount rewards program. There you can search our discount partners and see how to get the discounts.<br><br>You'll also get an email from time to time to let you know of any new businesses who join our discount partner program.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What happens if we don't reach enough subscribers to start running trade promotions?</summary>
                <p>As the saying goes, "hope for the best, plan for the worst." In the super unfortunate event that we don't reach enough subscribers, firstly we'd be very sad. But, in terms of the subscription fees that we've taken in, all remaining money will be donated to Greening Australia.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>When will the giveaways start?</summary>
                <p>As soon as we can! We need to reach a critical mass and stable number of subscribers in order to be able to sustain the giveaways each quarter. Bear with us while we do that and in the meantime, know that the earlier you sign up and the more people you get to join, the more chances you get in the first year of giveaways.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Are my contributions tax deductible?</summary>
                <p>Unfortunately no. We are not a not-for-profit or charity. We are a for purpose social enterprise that allows you to offset your ecological footprint and a loyalty rewards club.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Can people from outside Australia join?</summary>
                <p>Yes! Anyone from anywhere can subscribe to offset their ecological footprint. If you're not in Australia, you can still get access to the discounts with our discount partners if (a) you don't have to purchase in store and (b) they ship to your destination. You can also be part of the giveaways (if the country you're subscribing from allows it – best to check your country's rules and regulations), but will have to take ownership of any prizes in Australia, and/or have a delivery address in Australia – you should get some legal advice on how this would work.</p>
